Current building of the museum is located in the transition area between city blocks and industrial zone. In order to create a more dynamic relation to its surrounding and to better connect it to the neighboring block, the proposal integrated the existing building into a new space configuration with circular flow and opened views to public spaces around the complex. Museum building establishes a strong visual identity with its presence, and makes an inviting gesture towards visitors.
