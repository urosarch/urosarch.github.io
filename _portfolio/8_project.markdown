The drawing is the reconstruction of the project of a Serbian architect Nikola Dobrović, that he made for his summer house on the island of Lopud in Croatia. It is not a classical architectural drawing, but it rather represents an introspection aimed at discovering the hidden layers of the project. This was achieved by superposing floor plans in order to visualize the volume of the building and reveal the construction materials underneath. Each building stone was carefully drawn according to the stereometric principles of stone construction. This drawing was exhibited at the main exhibition of the 12th Belgrade International Architecture Week 2017 "Originally on Nikola Dobrović: Contemporary Architecture Drawing Glossary" and at the 2022 BINA exhibition in Kragujevac at the Pavillion of Nikola Koka Janković. Motto of the 2017 exhibition was: "An architect is a builder who has learned Latin." (Adolf Loos)
