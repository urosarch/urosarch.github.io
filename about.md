Hi there, let me brifely introduce myself. I am an Arhitect and Urban Designer based in Berlin, but besides that I'm also a curious mind that spans accross architecture, urbanism, digital technologies, ecology, innovation and much more. I have obtained a Master of Science in Urban Design (M.Sc. Urban Design) at the Technical University of Berlin and a Master in Architecture (M.Arch) degree from the University of Belgrade. Always open to new projects and ideas!
