The story of Gaia begins with the formation of organic matter or primitive life forms and their correlation to inorganic matter such as air, water and earth. In the con text of looking at these layers of life through the prism of spheres, we could also abstract them into Earth’s different skins. The natural world created as a result of evolution, with humans being a part of it, would in this story constitute the so called First Skin of the Earth. The Second Skin constitutes of humanly made urban structures and infrastructures. The Third Skin is an intertwined hyperobject of both physical and digital dimensions. It is at the same time a hardware, software and energy based global system, which implies physical devices such as sensors, drones, satellites, antennas, data centres and even AI cyborgs on one hand, and intangible worlds of data transferred in the form of bites or quants, depending on the computers used at the time of choosing. Many scenarios exist that try to anticipate how general artificial intelligence will be used, some of them predicting a more benign purposes while others predict technocratic surveillance based dictatorships where relations between humans, nonhumans and technology.



<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/3.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/5.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	This image can also have a caption. It's like magic. 
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above: 

	<div class="img_row">
	  <img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
	  <img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
	</div>
