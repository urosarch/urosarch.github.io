This speculative project explores the capacity of the grid both on macro and on micro level. Grid is a powerful construct that can accommodate different typologies, which also has the potential to regulate while at the same time allowing for "three-dimensional anarchy". Even when applied in two different contexts such as New York City and Belgrade, it preserves its strong character. Building as an urban prototype serves as a testing ground for different kind of experiments such as food production, electricity production and other innovative research. Center is by itself a didactic mean which establishes a feedback loop between the city and its activities.
